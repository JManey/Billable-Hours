Billable Hours Project

The goal of this project is to create a user dashboard for a small lawfirm to manage day to day activities.  

It will need a seach feature that can look up clients, contacts, users, documents.

It will need an appointment calendar.

It will need to track tasks and assign them to users, track how long it took to complete and ad that time to the task and save it to the matter at hand.

A 'firm feed' feature to display on the dashboard showing: completed tasks, started tasks, upcoming appts, etc...

Sign in with google Oauth.  And use google for calendar tools.

A dropdown on the left side under the search bar that provides dashboard links.

A dropdown button on the right side called 'new tasks' with a dropdown of clickable new items e.g. new matter, new contact, new bill, new communication, new calendar event, new document upload...
