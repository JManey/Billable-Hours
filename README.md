# Billable Hours Project

The goal of this project is to create a user dashboard for a small lawfirm to manage day to day activities.  I chose this project because my wife is a paralegal and the software she uses at work has a steep learning curve.

This app currently tracks tasks and assigns them to users.  Allows for adding/editing/deleting users and clients.  Requires user to be an admin to perform user edits.  Requires user to login with google Oauth to use the site.

# Technologies Used: 
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB / Mongoose
* JavaScript
* BootStrap / CSS
* HTML
* Passport with Google Oauth


# Getting Started:
* Click the [Link to App](https://law-firm-task-manager.herokuapp.com/) and sign in to get started.
* Since you are not an admin you will not be able to access the users information.
* You may request admin priviledges at jdm216@gmail.com.

# Next Steps:
* Need to implement a calendar to track appointments.
* Need a live feed that displays status updates for tasks, appointments, clients.
* Need to be able to upload documents to a third party such as dropbox and have the location referenced back to the matter and stored in mongoDB.
* A timer feature to track how long users spend on tasks(this will require implementing some acutal legal forms as templates).
